//! Spawns and kills background processes that are needed by Neon CLI.
//! Applies common set-up such as log and pid files (if needed) to every process.
//!
//! Neon CLI does not run in background, so it needs to store the information about
//! spawned processes, which it does in this module.
//! We do that by storing the pid of the process in the "${process_name}.pid" file.
//! The pid file can be created by the process itself
//! (Neon storage binaries do that and also ensure that a lock is taken onto that file)
//! or we create such file after starting the process
//! (non-Neon binaries don't necessarily follow our pidfile conventions).
//! The pid stored in the file is later used to stop the service.
//!
//! See [`lock_file`] module for more info.

    // pre_exec is marked unsafe because it runs between fork and exec.
    // Why is that dangerous in various ways?
    // Long answer:  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39575
    // Short answer: in a multi-threaded program, other threads may have
    // been inside of critical sections at the time of fork. In the
    // original process, that was allright, assuming they protected
    // the critical sections appropriately, e.g., through locks.
    // Fork adds another process to the mix that
    //   1. Has a single thread T
    //   2. In an exact copy of the address space at the time of fork.
    // A variety of problems scan occur now:
    //   1. T tries to grab a lock that was locked at the time of fork.
    //      It will wait forever since in its address space, the lock
    //      is in state 'taken' but the thread that would unlock it is
    //      not there.
    //   2. A rust object that represented some external resource in the
    //      parent now got implicitly copied by the the fork, even though
    //      the object's type is not `Copy`. The parent program may use
    //      non-copyability as way to enforce unique ownership of an
    //      external resource in the typesystem. The fork breaks that
    //      assumption, as now both parent and child process have an
    //      owned instance of the object that represents the same
    //      underlying resource.
    // While these seem like niche problems, (1) in particular is
    // highly relevant. For example, `malloc()` may grab a mutex internally,
    // and so, if we forked while another thread was mallocing' and our
    // pre_exec closure allocates as well, it will block on the malloc
    // mutex forever
    //
    // The proper solution is to only use C library functions that are marked
    // "async-signal-safe": https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html
    //
    // With this specific pre_exec() closure, the non-error path doesn't allocate.
    // The error path uses `anyhow`, and hence does allocate.
    // We take our chances there, hoping that any potential disaster is constrained
    // to the child process (e.g., malloc has no state ourside of the child process).
    // Last, `expect` prints to stderr, and stdio is not async-signal-safe.
    // Again, we take our chances, making the same assumptions as for malloc.
